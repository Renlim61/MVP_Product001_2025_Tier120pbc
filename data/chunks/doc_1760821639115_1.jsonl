{"text": "Software testing activities \r\nThis file provides information on the standard activities and deliverables involved in the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). The STLC is a structured process used to ensure the quality, reliability, and functionality of a software product before its release. \r\n1. Requirement Analysis \r\nThis is the first phase, where the test team analyzes the software's requirements from a testing perspective.\r\nPurpose: To identify testable requirements and create a clear understanding of the project's scope.\r\nActivities:\r\nReview functional and non-functional requirements.\r\nConduct feasibility studies for test automation.\r\nIdentify and prioritize testing requirements.\r\nDeliverable: A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) that maps each requirement to its corresponding test cases. \r\n2. Test Planning \r\nThe QA team creates a comprehensive test plan and strategy for the project.\r\nPurpose: To define the scope, resources, schedule, and approach for the entire testing process.\r\nActivities:\r\nDefine test objectives and strategy.\r\nEstimate test effort and cost.\r\nDefine roles, responsibilities, and resources.\r\nIdentify necessary testing tools.\r\nDeliverable: An approved Test Pl"}

Test Case Development \r\nThe team designs, writes, and prepares the specific test cases that will be executed.\r\nPurpose: To create a blueprint for testing that covers all functional and non-functional aspects.\r\nActivities:\r\nCreate detailed test cases with steps, expected results, and test data.\r\nDevelop and review automation scripts.\r\nCreate and approve test data.\r\nDeliverables: Test cases, test scripts, and test data. \r\n4. Test Environment Setup \r\nThis phase involves setting up a test environment that simulates real-world usage.\r\nPurpose: To prepare the hardware, software, and network configuration needed to execute the tests.\r\nActivities:\r\nInstall and configure the test environment.\r\nPerform a \"smoke test\" to ensure the environment's readiness.\r\nPrepare and set up test data.\r\nDeliverable: The configured and ready Test Environment. \r\n5.

Test Execution \r\nThe team carries out the tests according to the test plan and logs any defects.\r\nPurpose: To run the test cases and validate the software's behavior against the expected results.\r\nActivities:\r\nExecute test cases.\r\nCompare actual results to expected outcomes.\r\nReport defects and map them to test cases in the RTM.\r\nConduct re-testing and regression testing as needed.\r\nDeliverable: Test execution reports and defect reports. \r\n6. Test Cycle Closure \r\nThe testing process is formally concluded, and a final report is created.\r\nPurpose: To summarize test results, analyze the testing process, and determine if the project's goals were met.\r\nActivities:\r\nEvaluate test metrics, test coverage, and achieved quality.\r\nDiscuss lessons learned to improve future testing.\r\nPrepare and distribute the Test Closure Report.\r\nDeliverable: The Test Closure Report, which includes a test summary report."}
